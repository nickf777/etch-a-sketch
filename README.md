# etch-a-sketch

This is the Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project. Through this project, I want to get more comfortable with DOM manipulation as well as learn more about positioning elements using flexbox.

Update: Now that the project is complete, here's a list of things I learned:
- How to generate a grid using JavaScript
- How to add event listeners to each space in the grid to mimic an etch-a-sketch
- How to manipulate the DOM to resize and reset the styling of the grid
- Got some practice with flexbox, transitions, and basic styling

What I want to add moving forward:
- Changing the hover effect on the grid to a random RGB value rather than just black and white
- Some more exciting and advanced styling
